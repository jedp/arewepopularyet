# Are We Popular
Are we getting traction? Are we a mainstream authentication option?

One way to measure this,
is to look at adoption and abandonment rates in github codebases.

## Criteria

Several searches are performed daily against github's code search API.

See [searches.json](etc/searches.json).

## TODOs
* append search category and total numbers into .JSON file
* make a directory for today's run
* Take rate-limiting into account and eventually get all the data
